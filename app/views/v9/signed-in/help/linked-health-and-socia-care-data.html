          <p class="govuk-body">Calculated as the number of people within each cohort that met the criteria for the cohort. Note a hierarchy is applied to the cohorts and so if an individual meets the criteria for more than one cohort they will fall into the highest ranked cohort only. The hierarchy was based on the client level data extracts and decided with an expert group of local authority commissioners, analysts, clinicians and social care practitioners.</p>
          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The percentage of people within each cohort that went on to receive long-term adult social care arranged for by the local authority within 12 months of an acute hospital event</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">Calculated as the number of people within each cohort who go on to start a new long-term care package arranged for by the local authority within 12 months of an acute hospital event divided by the total number of people within each cohort.</p>
