        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Summary of initiative or policy</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The Data Access Project includes the design, development and delivery of a new digital service called "Get Adult Social Care Data" to improve access to adult social care data for all key stakeholders in the sector (i.e. care providers, local authorities, academic researchers and government analysts) who need it to make better decisions to improve the quality of care for individuals. The service processes information drawn through APIs from existing data sets to show ready-made analytical insight on one place on GOV.UK and provides easy access to the data held on different sites.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">In order to ensure that users of the service can only access information that they are legally allowed to see under current data sharing agreements, we ask users to apply for a user account. To create and maintain the account, we collect some personal information from them and store this on the tool. This information is submitted by the user who wishes to have an account.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Data controller</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is the data controller for the <abbr title="{{serviceName}}">GASCD</abbr> service.</p>
