    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">The government collects and stores a significant amount of adult social care data from care providers and local authorities. This data is currently used for government purposes. The government is in the process of building a new data service so that the existing data can also be used to help answer the questions that are most important to adult social care stakeholders, such as care providers.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This new digital service is owned by DHSC and is being developed by the data access project. Its aim is to support adult social care stakeholders to make better evidence-based decisions, which will help them improve outcomes for people who need adult social care services. The project does not collect any additional information, but instead aims to share data that is already being collected with people who need it. Data shared through the tool complies with current Data Sharing Agreements.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The information in this service has been developed and designed with ongoing support from a range of care providers, to understand what data insight is most useful. Over time, it is anticipated that the service will expand and change to include new topics and new user groups.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Please note that this service provides information only and does not constitute advice.
