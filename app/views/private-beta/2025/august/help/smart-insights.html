    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Overview</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Smart insights is a feature that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help analyse data and identify key trends and patterns.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This is designed to support &ndash; but not replace &ndash; your own analysis of the data.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">As it's experimental, there are some limitations to keep in mind.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Smart insights uses AI models trained on large datasets to identify relationships within the data.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">These models generate summaries and interpretations designed to simplify complex information and help you uncover useful insights.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Limitations</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">AI&#45;generated insights are generally reliable, but may not always be complete, reflect the most recent policy changes, or capture important context.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Sometimes, AI might misinterpret data, producing insights that do not fully align with the underlying trends or patterns.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Best practices</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Always cross&#45;check the AI&#45;generated insights with other data sources to get a fuller picture.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Review the insights carefully, and verify they are correct and appropriate for your needs before sharing or using them.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">To help us refine and improve this feature, please <a href="#" class="govuk-link" data-message="Sorry, this hasn’t been designed yet">share your feedback</a>.</p>
