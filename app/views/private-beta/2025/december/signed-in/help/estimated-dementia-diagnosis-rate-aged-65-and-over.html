        <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">The estimated dementia diagnosis rate is calculated by comparing the number of people aged 65 and older with a recorded dementia diagnosis on GP registers to the estimated number of people in that age group who are likely to have dementia, based on national prevalence rates. The estimates use population data and standard prevalence models to provide an expected number of cases.</dd>

          Organisations with a smaller denominator population than the reference population used for calculating estimated rates should be interpreted with caution. This is true for City of London and Isles of Scilly. All counts are greater than 300, except for City of London and Isles of Scilly. Both of these have indicator values close to 50 percent so the normal approximation is still sufficiently accurate.
