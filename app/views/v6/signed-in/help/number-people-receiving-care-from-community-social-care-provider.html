                    Care providers registered with the CQC must update this information at least monthly using the Capacity Tracker tool. The mandated reporting period is between the 8th and 14th every month, or the next working day if the 14th falls on a weekend or holiday.

                    Small number suppression is applied. All providers with less than 6 service users are suppressed and removed from aggregate counts to avoid identification.
