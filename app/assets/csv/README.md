# READ ME (app/assets/csv/)
This folder contains .csv files for some of the data visualisations in the prototype.

+ beds.csv - a set of dates with values, used for creating a time series chart
+ las.csv - a set of local authorities with data next to them

Anything in the 'archive' folder might be useful for other experiments.
